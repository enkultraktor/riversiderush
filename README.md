the popfile for riverside rush

if you download the popfile you have to implement it into the population folder
you do so like this

steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/scripts/population

drag and drop the file in there, do not change the name of the file, as  the popfile can only be read if it matches the mission which is mvm_rottenburg if you want to rename the mission just write mvm_rottenburg_another_mission.pop

in game when you call vote to change the difficulty between levels such as advanced 1 and advanced 2 you would see riverside rush or if you rename it you would see it there, here i gave an example on renaming it to another mission so that would come up
